        Description
    </h2>

    <p>
        Ropa Vieja is Cuba's ultimate comfort food, tender shredded flank steak simmered in a rich tomato-based sauce with onions, garlic, and bell peppers.
        This recipe by Chef John layers in bold spices like cumin, paprika, oregano, and a touch of cayenne, then finishes with briny green olives, capers, and fresh cilantro for that signature cuban flavor.
        The result? A savory, slighly smoky stew that's deeply satisfying and full of character.

        What sets this version apart is the overnight rest-it lets the flavors meld and the beefsoak up every ounce of the sauce.
        Traditionally served with white rice, black beans, and fried plantains, it's a dish that feels both homey and celebratory.
        Whether you're new to cuban cuisine or a longtime fan, this Ropa Vieja delivers a taste of Havana in every bite.
